# vscode-to-vs-extension

This extension allows you to create the files needed for a Visual Studio C++ project, mainly for operating systems that do not support Visual Studio C++ development.

This extension was also made with permission from [wzid](https://github.com/wzid), a friend who made the original CLI-based version.

## **Usage**
1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) or (Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type in `>Generate C++ Solution Files`
3. Enter the name of the project when prompted
