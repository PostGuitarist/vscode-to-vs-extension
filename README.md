# vscode-to-vs-extension

This extension allows you to create the files needed for a Visual Studio C++ project, mainly for operating systems that do not support Visual Studio C++ development.

This extension was also made with permission from [wzid](https://github.com/wzid), a friend who made the original CLI-based version.

## **Installation**
- Download the .vsix from the Releases page
- Open the **Extensions** tab in VSCode, click the three small dots at the top, and click **Install from VSIX**
**OR**
- Open the **Command Palette** and enter **Extensions: Install from VSIX**
**OR**
- Run the command
  ```
  code --install-extension vscode-to-vs-1.1.0.vsix
  ```

## **Future**
Eventually, this extension will end up on the VSCode Extension Marketplace. This process takes some time, and there are other features I want to add.
